            A woman is the full circle. Within her is the power to create, nurture and transform. 
            The question isn’t who’s going to let me; it’s who is going to stop me.
            Courage is like a muscle. We strengthen it by use.
            Think like a queen. A queen is not afraid to fail. Failure is another steppingstone to greatness.
            Is it already dark there? It is already dark here. There are a large number of stars in the sky. The sky always amazes me. It seems to be limitless without any boundaries. You have a strange resemblance to this sky. You amaze me just like this beautiful sky and my feelings for you have no boundaries. I am simply unable to put limits or boundaries to my love for you. It keeps on increasing.
            The rising sun always brightens my morning. The cool soothing breeze in the evening cools my thoughts. The singing birds bring untold joy to my heart. However, nothing makes me feel complete like seeing your beautiful face. I love you and will always love you.
            I want you to know that you are the most important thing in my life. You’re the reason I do everything. When I get up in the morning, I feel so grateful for every second I have with you and have here on earth. You give my life meaning, you give my days such joy, you are the reason I smile. Thank you for being with me, for joining me on this journey through life. Your love is everything to me.
